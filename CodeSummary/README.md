# CodeSummary

The library has 2 main components:

1. models
2. server

The models directory is where all of the model code is stored. The main model 
that is included in this repository is LAMNER, but you can add in any model you
would like as long as it follows the same syntax.

## Examples.py

This contains some sample classes that were created, they show how to deploy
using a single model or multiple models. If you have cloned the whole repository
you can see how they are called in the `main.py` file in the root of the repo.
